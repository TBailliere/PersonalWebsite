      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <span class="dot2"></span>
      <p>I was born in Belgium but moved to Sweden when I was 8 years old. In Sweden, I attended international schools,
        where the subject-matter was all taught in English. Hence, I feel as though English is my native language,
        rather than Dutch. After graduating high school in Sweden, I taught English in China for a while before coming
        back to Europe for my studies. </p>
      <p>Fast forward a few years and I found myself at a crossroads. I wasn’t enjoying
        the job I held and wanted more out of my life. I dread being a cog in the machine. I want to create. After much
        searching, deliberating and consulting with others, I
        decided to go back to school and enroll at <strong> Thomas More </strong><em>hogeschool</em> (school for
        advanced education) to obtain a <em>graduaat</em> (associate's degree) in programming.
        In case
        you are
        interested in what exactly I will be learning throughout this program, I encourage you to press the button below
        to find out more. I’m excited to share this journey with you!</p>
